# Sv2Wav

A Python script to automate export of [SunVox](https://www.warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/) project files. Pretty much just an adaptation of [the library's C example #4](https://github.com/warmplace/sunvox_dll/blob/master/examples/c/test4.c) with command-line arguments.

Currently only supports Windows as I don't have access to testing hardware for other platforms.
